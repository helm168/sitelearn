            <p>There are many ways to make visual representations of data: bar charts, line graphs, scatter diagrams, sparklines... not to mention the many ways in which you can implement them on the web. In this post I'll be looking at plain CSS methods for styling data. But before we take a look at some examples, I think it's worth briefly going over our design goals first.</p>



            <h3>Guidelines for Chart Making</h3>
            <p>There are three guidelines to developing a chart on the web:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: everyone should be able to view some format of the data we present, even if it's a boring table (boring is better than nothing).</li>
              <li><strong>Ease of development</strong>: graph-making shouldn't be unnecessarily complex, and we'll certainly want to avoid technical debt for the future.</li>
              <li><strong>Performance</strong>: we need to make sure that users don't spend a lot of time waiting for assets to download or for elements to be painted to the screen.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These goals are likely to change depending on the type of chart that make, as performance is going to be less of a concern for a static bar chart than <a href="#">a crazy interactive map</a>. With these guidelines in mind, let's look at a few examples.</p>



            <h3>CSS Bar Charts</h3>
            <p>There are a couple of ways to make a simple bar chart in CSS. For starters we'll use a definition list for our data:</p>
            <pre rel="HTML">
              <textarea class="js-to-wrap">
 <dl>
  <dt>title of the graph</dt>
  <dd class="percentage">
    <span class="text">
      Data 1: 20%
    </span>
  </dd>
  <dd class="percentage">
    <span class="text">
      Data 2: 50%
    </span>
  </dd>
  <dd class="percentage">
    <span class="text">
      Data 3: 30%
    </span>
  </dd>
</dl></textarea></pre>
